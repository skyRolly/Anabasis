# DOCUMENTATION_COVERAGE.md

Permanent documentation-coverage audit. **Future contributors/AI must update this on every
documentation-affecting change** (`docs/policies/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE_POLICY.md`).

Coverage = how well the module/topic is documented. Confidence = strength of the evidence behind
that documentation (Verified / Partially Verified / Unverified / Not Supported).

**Last updated:** for the **third review pass** (2026-07-30). Four findings fixed, three were
confirmations or verified non-issues.

**A regression introduced by the previous pass — the macOS build silently lost two flags.** The
`TODO(P1, OQ-011)` comment added last pass sat *inside* a `run: >` folded block scalar. YAML joins
every line of a folded block into one line and gives `#` no meaning, so bash saw a single command
with a trailing comment and dropped everything after it — `-DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` **and**
`-DANABASIS_BUILD_NUMBER`. Consequence once P1 lands: macOS builds would carry an unintended
minimum-OS setting and report **build number 0** in the About box, which the bug-report form asks
testers to quote. No error would have revealed it. The comment now lives above the step, says why
it must stay there, and a checker asserts every configure flag survives comment-stripping on all
three platforms.

**The randomise pluginval step ran after a failed build.** Its `if: ${{ !cancelled() }}` forced it
to run when the build had failed, producing a second red step complaining about a missing plugin —
exactly the noise the staging/packaging guards were fixed for in the previous pass. Now
`!cancelled() && steps.build.outcome == 'success'` on all three jobs (the Linux build step gained
the `id` it needed); the deterministic step has no `if:` and already skipped itself correctly. The
"both modes report independently" intent is unchanged.

**`FUTURE_RISKS` RISK-003 cited `TESTING_POLICY` rule 4** for the hostile-input requirement, which
the previous pass's renumbering moved to rule **5** (rule 4 is now the skipped-test-category rule).
Swept the repository for other stale rule pointers — the two remaining (`POSTMORTEMS`, `TESTING.md`,
both rule 1) are correct.

**Verified, no change:** the issue-form / `config.yml` URLs use `skyRolly/Anabasis`, which matches
both this repository's git remote and the sibling product's own links — the casing is the canonical
display slug, not a mismatch. CodeQL's `paths-ignore` is an alert filter, which is exactly what its
inline comment claims. The `run-tests.sh` fail-closed discovery was re-confirmed behaviourally.
The branch-protection interactions (`build.yml` same-repo PR skip, `codeql.yml` `paths-ignore`)
were already documented in `CI_CD.md` §"Before enabling branch protection" in the previous pass.

Prior: for the **second review pass** (2026-07-30). Eleven findings addressed.

**The overview contradicted the decisions.** README §Project status still listed the JUCE pin and
the plugin identity as open items "not to be guessed at" after the same change set resolved and
froze both, and the `DEVELOPMENT_BRIEF` §23 delta table still said the JUCE tag "must be checked at
P0" — contradicted three sections later by §23.2. README now separates *decided and frozen* from
*still open*, and §23 gained a **Plugin identity** row so the delta table records the real
difference (`RTec`/`Anbs`/`com.rollytech.anabasis`, VST3 categories Fx/Dynamics/Mastering) rather
than a stale instruction.

**CI correctness.** The Windows staging and macOS packaging steps ran on `!cancelled()` alone, so a
failed *build* let them run and fail a second time on missing paths — a red step unrelated to the
cause; both now also require `steps.build.outcome == 'success'` (the Linux job needs no guard, its
strip step has no `if:`). `objcopy --add-gnu-debuglink` recorded a CI-workspace path that exists on
no user's machine, so a downloaded `-debug` artifact would never be found automatically; objcopy now
runs from inside the debug dir with a bare basename, the conventional lookup. The hand-rolled PE
CodeView parser now bounds-checks `PointerToRawData` before indexing, so a truncated image produces
the intended diagnosable error instead of a raw .NET exception.

**Honesty about what the gate covers.** The `build.yml` header claimed the release gate validates
the shipped bytes; that is true only on **Linux**, where the strip precedes pluginval. macOS and
Windows strip (and macOS signs) *after* validation, so a defect introduced by stripping or signing
would ship unvalidated there. Stated plainly in the header and in `CI_CD.md`, and raised as
**OQ-012** for P6 — reordering is not free (macOS must codesign last) and deserves a measurement,
not a guess.

**Branch-protection traps documented before they bite.** `CI_CD.md` gained a "before enabling
branch protection" section: `build.yml`'s same-repo PR skip reports a *skipped* conclusion (fine,
but the first thing to check if a required check ever hangs), and — the sharper one — `codeql.yml`'s
`paths-ignore` means the workflow is **never created** for docs-only PRs, so a required CodeQL check
would block them forever. Neither is a bug; both are traps if configured blindly. The standard
same-job-names no-op companion workflow is named as the fix, to be added when CodeQL is made
required and not before.

**Scripts.** `run-tests.sh` now fails closed on **ambiguity** as well as absence: `find | head -n1`
would silently gate on whichever binary `find` emitted first, so a stale second build tree could
produce a green report about the wrong artifact. Verified in all three cases (none / exactly one /
two). `run-pluginval.sh`'s `chmod +x … || true` no longer swallows a setup failure that would
otherwise resurface as an opaque "cannot execute" from the validation loop.

**Also:** `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.13` was inherited unexamined — arm64 macOS starts at 11.0,
so the arm64 slice's minimum is silently raised, and 10.13 may sit below JUCE 9's floor. Carrying a
`TODO(P1)` and raised as **OQ-011**; not guessed at, since the deployment target is a user-visible
support claim (C7). `TESTING_POLICY`'s rule "3a" did not render as a list item (Markdown does not
recognise `3a.`), so the skipped-test-category rule — cross-referenced from the coverage audit — is
renumbered to **rule 4**, with the hostile-inputs rule to 5.

Prior: for the **first review pass** (2026-07-30). Ten findings fixed. Corrected in that
audit: the policies row said 15 docs, the tree has **16**. Scripts: `setup-linux.sh` now installs
`curl` + `unzip` (`run-pluginval.sh` calls both; `libcurl4-openssl-dev` is headers, not the CLI, and
GitHub runners preinstall them — so the gap only ever showed on a fresh machine);
`run-pluginval.ps1` **no longer passes `--skip-gui-tests`**, which was inherited from the sibling
product where an evidenced runner limitation justifies it, and here suppressed nothing while
contradicting the "uniform and blocking on every platform" gate — `TESTING_POLICY` gains rule 4
requiring any future skip to be documented, not merely scripted; `build.sh` `find` calls take
`-maxdepth` before `-name`. CI: all actions re-aligned to the versions the sibling repository runs
green (`checkout@v7`, `upload-artifact@v7`, `codeql-action@v4`, `dependency-review-action@v5`) —
the scaffold had them a major version behind; `preflight` now skips same-repo `pull_request` events
that `push: ["**"]` already built; the Linux/Windows debug uploads gate on a `debug_artifacts`
output written last rather than on "not skipped", so an aborted symbol step cannot produce a second
misleading `if-no-files-found` failure. Docs: `CI_CD.md`'s pipeline list claimed self-tests before
symbol handling — on Linux the strip runs **first**, deliberately, so the gate validates the
shipped bytes; the list is now per-platform. `DSP_POLICY` invariant 2 and the release checklist
asserted "with lookahead 0 … reported latency is 0", which §4.3's 0.5–10 ms range makes unreachable
— rephrased against the engaged lookahead, with the underlying question raised as **OQ-010**
(does lookahead get an explicit off position? — it must be settled before the parameter exists,
since widening a range later is compatibility-gated). `bug_report.yml` uses an absolute doc URL
(a relative one does not resolve from `/issues/new`).

Prior: for the **OQ-001 / OQ-003 resolutions** (2026-07-30). Two blocking decisions
moved to `Resolved` in `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md` (entries are never deleted): the JUCE pin is **9.0.0 at
commit `f8f8864…`**, the same revision Anamorph pins, so the product line shares one framework
baseline; and the plugin identity is **`RTec` / `Anbs` / `com.rollytech.anabasis`**, with the
vendor code spelling RollyTech rather than the first product. Synced: README (§Requirements),
`DEPENDENCY_POLICY` (pin row + the shared-pin rationale), `BUILD.md` (toolchain, options table,
new §Plugin identity), `HANDOVER` (dependency row, Known Blockers — now one, `DESIGN.md`
sign-off), `DEVELOPMENT_BRIEF` §23.2. Both values must be written into `CMakeLists.txt` at P1 and
are frozen from the first build that leaves this repository. Anabasis pays nothing for the
identity decision because it has never built; the sibling product absorbs the one-time break
(Anamorph 0.9.1 / its ADR-0023 / its KI-016). No `src/` change — there is still no `src/`.

Prior: repository bootstrap — the migration of Anamorph's governance system,
documentation library, build/CI scaffolding and working conventions into a previously empty
Anabasis repository, plus the product brief (`docs/DEVELOPMENT_BRIEF.md`, Part I unchanged from
the owner-supplied prompt + an additive Part II recording the inherited engineering standard).
No `src/`, no `tests/`, no `CMakeLists.txt` — so every claim about runtime behaviour in this
repository is `Unverified` **by construction**, and the policies state invariants the future code
must satisfy rather than compliance it already has (constraint C7).

## Code-module coverage

| Module | Documented in | Coverage | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(none — `src/` does not exist)* | — | — | — |

Rows are added as modules land. The planned module set and its responsibilities are listed in
`docs/REPOSITORY_MAP.md` §`src/`; that is a **plan**, not coverage.

## Documentation-set self-coverage (deliverables present)

| Tier | Files | Status |
|---|---|---|
| docs root | DEVELOPMENT_BRIEF, SOURCE_OF_TRUTH, REPOSITORY_MAP, OPEN_QUESTIONS, HANDOVER, DOCUMENTATION_COVERAGE, KNOWN_ISSUES, FUTURE_RISKS, POSTMORTEMS, BRAND_CONSISTENCY_CHECKLIST | Present |
| policies | 16 docs (incl. the Anabasis-specific `MODE_AND_ADAPTATION_POLICY`) | Present |
| procedures | BUILD, DEVELOPMENT, CI_CD, TESTING, RELEASE_PROCESS, RELEASE_COMPATIBILITY_CHECKLIST, TROUBLESHOOTING | Present (PACKAGING deferred to P6) |
| architecture | `design-decisions/ADR_INDEX.md` only | Skeleton — the descriptive set lands with P1–P2 |
| user | — | Deferred to P6 |
| worklogs | — | Empty (no investigation has happened yet) |
| root — developer/status | README, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE | Present |
| root — legal | — | Deferred to P6 (produced against a real dependency tree; copying another project's inventory would be invented evidence) |

## Known coverage gaps / TODOs

These are **deliberate**, not oversights. Each names what would close it.

- **No architecture set** — `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `SIGNAL_FLOW.md`, `DSP_GRAPH_REFERENCE.md`,
  `THREAD_MODEL.md`, `PARAMETER_REGISTRY.md`, `SERIALIZATION_REGISTRY.md`, `LATENCY_MODEL.md`,
  `REALTIME_SAFETY_AUDIT.md`, `COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md`, `DSP_ALGORITHMS.md`,
  `PERFORMANCE_BUDGET.md` all describe code that does not exist. Closed by P1–P2.
- **No ADRs** — ADRs are evidence-driven (constraint C1); the first batch comes out of P0's
  `DESIGN.md`. `ADR_INDEX.md` exists as the registry.
- **Policy compliance sections are `TODO (no code yet)`** in `REALTIME_AUDIO_POLICY`,
  `THREADING_POLICY`, `DSP_POLICY` and `MODE_AND_ADAPTATION_POLICY`. Closed as each phase lands,
  with evidence citations.
- **No performance or aliasing numbers anywhere** — and none may be written until measured with a
  recorded machine and methodology (constraint C2). Closed by `TEST_REPORT.md` at P2/P6.
- **No host (DAW) matrix** — requires manual testing. Closed by the P6 DAW smoke tests.
- **Legal / attribution class absent** — closed at P6 against the actually-pinned JUCE tree.
- **`docs/user/` absent** — closed at P6.

## Update protocol

On any change, set this file's "Last updated" to the new HEAD (or the change description before
the first tag) and adjust the affected rows. A new module → add a row; a new doc → add to
self-coverage; new measured data → upgrade the confidence. Never upgrade a confidence level
without the evidence that justifies it.
