// ============================================================================
//  GrHistoryView — the §2.9 scrolling GR/waveform history (DESIGN §6.2/§6.3
//  bottom strip; Pro-L 2 presentation as the stated reference): the block
//  waveform peaks filled from the baseline, the gain-reduction trace hanging
//  from the top, over a 10–30 s window.
//
//  Reader contract (THREAD_MODEL, decided at the P5 opening): stateless
//  `peek`s against `available()`, and the RESET EPOCH sampled before and
//  after every batch — odd or moved means the batch raced a host-thread
//  clear and the frame is discarded (the reader re-derives from the fresh
//  index next tick; nothing is cached across an epoch change).
//
//  Time base: one ring entry spans one HOST block (the recorded caveat), so
//  the window is mapped through the CURRENT prepared block size — an
//  approximation that drifts only when the host's delivered blocks differ
//  from its prepared size, and only in display width, never in data.
