# Changelog

All notable changes to **Anabasis** are documented here.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versioning:
`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, pre-1.0 line (< 1.0.0 = pre-release). Maintained per
[`docs/policies/CHANGELOG_POLICY.md`](docs/policies/CHANGELOG_POLICY.md):

- **User-visible changes only.** Refactors, cleanups, formatting and renames are not entries
  unless a commit/PR explicitly states a user-visible impact.
- **No invented history.** Every entry cites an Evidence Source (commit SHA, commit range, PR or
  release tag). An entry that cannot be tied to such evidence is marked
  `[Unverified Historical Reconstruction]`.
- **Renames are `Changed`, not `Removed`** (a display-name change with an unchanged parameter ID).
- Compatibility-affecting entries cross-link the relevant ADR and note any migration.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **P1 skeleton — the plugin exists** (VST3 / AU-on-macOS / Standalone; JUCE 9.0.0 pinned):
  the 49-parameter surface of `DESIGN.md` §4.2 (IDs frozen, registry snapshot under
  `tests/fixtures/`), a pass-through chain with a basic lookahead limiter and the final ceiling
  clamp, constant reported latency (10 ms lookahead allowance — browsing presets never moves
  host PDC, ADR-0004), Simple-mode macro knobs mapped by the §5.5 draft curves, schema-v1
  session state with A/B slots, and a placeholder editor. No EQ/compressor/clipper processing,
  no oversampling, no metering yet — those are P2–P5.
  Evidence Source: commits `91ece13` (skeleton), `e0c24d5` (limiter alignment + state
  restore fixes) and the smoothing/contract commit that follows them on
  `claude/anabasis-init-migration-mvbbq9`. [Verified]

The first entry will be `[0.1.0]`, cut at the end of P6.
